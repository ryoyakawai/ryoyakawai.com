<h2 class="hiryoya">Hi, I'm Ryoya Kawai !!</h2>
I am working as R&D Manager at musical instrument manufactuere. Howevenr, lots of my skills are basically coming from web technology because I had belonged to the division to develop new internet business as a software engineer as both frontend and backend for around 10 years.
From several years ago, I am participating audio working group at W3C(World Wide Web Consortium). The mission of audio working group is to discus/define the API for audio and for musical instrument connection(MIDI). What I am mostly doing there is to become a bridge between musical instruments manufacturer and other IT industry especially browser vendor to give them enough information to define specs.
<br>

Basically I love to see the web become a strong platform for making application for all purpose.
And I would like to spend my time for making the web forward, as much as I can do.
